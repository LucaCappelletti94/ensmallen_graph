"""
This file offers the methods to automatically retrieve the graph sc-msdoor.

The graph is automatically retrieved from the NetworkRepository repository. 



Report
---------------------
At the time of rendering these methods (please see datetime below), the graph
had the following characteristics:

Datetime: 2021-02-06 12:26:55.570531

The undirected graph sc-msdoor has 404785 nodes and 9378650 unweighted
edges, of which none are self-loops. The graph is quite sparse as it has
a density of 0.00011 and is connected, as it has a single component. The
graph median node degree is 47, the mean node degree is 46.34, and the
node degree mode is 34. The top 5 most central nodes are 202439 (degree
76), 202438 (degree 76), 202437 (degree 76), 156872 (degree 76) and 156871
(degree 76).

Usage example
----------------------
The usage of this graph is relatively straightforward:

.. code:: python

    # First import the function to retrieve the graph from the datasets
    from ensmallen_graph.datasets.networkrepository import ScMsdoor

    # Then load the graph
    graph = ScMsdoor()

    # Finally, you can do anything with it, for instance, compute its report:
    print(graph)

    # If you need to run a link prediction task with validation,
    # you can split the graph using a connected holdout as follows:
    train_graph, validation_graph = graph.connected_holdout(
        # You can use an 80/20 split the holdout, for example.
        train_size=0.8,
        # The random state is used to reproduce the holdout.
        random_state=42,
        # Wether to show a loading bar.
        verbose=True
    )

    # Remember that, if you need, you can enable the memory-time trade-offs:
    train_graph.enable(
        vector_sources=True,
        vector_destinations=True,
        vector_outbounds=True
    )

    # Consider using the methods made available in the Embiggen package
    # to run graph embedding or link prediction tasks.
